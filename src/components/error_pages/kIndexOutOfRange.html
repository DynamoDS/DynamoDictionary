    <h2>Index is out of range</h2>

    <p> 
        This error message means that your list does not contain an element at the index position you provided.
        For example if your list is <code>[1, 3, 5, 7]</code> and you try to access the element at index <code>5</code>, 
        you will be prompted with an error message as only elements at indices <code>0</code> through <code>3</code> exist 
        in the list.
    </p>

    <h4>How to fix</h4>

    <p>
        Make sure the index variable you are using to access elements in the list is greater than or equal
        to <code>0</code> and strictly less than list size.
